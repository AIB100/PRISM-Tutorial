# About PRISM

**PRISM** (Protein Receptor Interaction Simulation Modeler) is a comprehensive Python toolkit for building and analyzing protein-ligand molecular dynamics systems.

## Mission

PRISM's mission is to make high-quality molecular dynamics simulations accessible to researchers by automating the complex workflow of system preparation, simulation setup, and trajectory analysis.

## History

PRISM was developed at the Theoretical Chemistry Institute, University of Wisconsin-Madison, starting in 2023 to address the need for:

- **Automation**: Eliminate manual, error-prone system building steps
- **Flexibility**: Support multiple force field options
- **Reproducibility**: Consistent, documented workflows
- **Accessibility**: Lower barriers for non-experts

## Key Features

### System Building
- Automated protein-ligand system construction
- 8+ ligand force field options (GAFF, GAFF2, OpenFF, OPLS-AA, CGenFF, MMFF, MATCH, Hybrid)
- Multiple protein force fields (AMBER, CHARMM, OPLS)
- Intelligent protein preparation with metal ion handling
- One-command GROMACS integration

### Analysis
- Comprehensive trajectory analysis (RMSD, RMSF, contacts, H-bonds)
- Interactive HTML visualizations
- Automated plotting and reporting
- Publication-quality figures

### Advanced Calculations
- PMF/Umbrella sampling for binding free energies
- MM/PBSA calculations
- Batch processing for high-throughput screening
- Parallel execution support

## Design Philosophy

1. **Simple for Simple Tasks**: Common workflows should be one command
2. **Flexible for Complex Tasks**: Full control when needed
3. **Reproducible**: All settings documented and version controlled
4. **Well-Documented**: Clear examples and comprehensive docs
5. **Open Source**: Free and community-driven

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8-3.11
- **MD Engine**: GROMACS 2024.3+
- **Force Fields**: AmberTools, OpenFF, LigParGen, ParamChem
- **Analysis**: MDTraj, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- **Visualization**: RDKit, Plotly, custom HTML generators

## Use Cases

### Drug Discovery
- Virtual screening of compound libraries
- Binding affinity prediction
- Force field validation

### Structural Biology
- Protein-ligand binding mechanisms
- Conformational changes
- Allosteric effects

### Method Development
- Force field comparison and benchmarking
