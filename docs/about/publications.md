## Citation Guidelines

### In Methods Section

Example text for methods section:

> "Protein-ligand systems were built using PRISM (Protein Receptor Interaction Simulation Modeler) version 1.2.0 [citation]. Ligand force field parameters were generated using [GAFF/OpenFF/etc], and the protein was modeled with the AMBER99SB force field. The system was solvated in a TIP3P water box with 0.15 M NaCl. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using GROMACS 2024.3."

### In Acknowledgments

> "We thank Zhaoqi Shi for developing PRISM and providing support."
